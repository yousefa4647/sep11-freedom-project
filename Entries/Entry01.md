# Entry 1
 Ever since we started with the Freedom Project, I stood between two subjects. On one hand I want to research bitcoin, it's history, and whether or not it's worth investing or buying. On the other, I wanted to study animal cloning and the concept of using it to bring some species out of extinction. However for now, I am more leaning towards bitcoin as I have a target audience and a call for action whereas with cloning, I am just giving facts. Upon researching bitcoin, I learned alot. I found out that the identity of the creator(s) is unkown and that he/she/they uploaded the original software on sourcecode in 2009. I also learned that it was worth 8 cents when it first came out but in 10 years skyrocketed to 8,092 dollars which means that those who bought multiple then would've certainly made a fortune now. People obtain them either by buying it from others in broker websites or by having computers solve tricky math problems to generate some in a process known as "mining". However, the currency has some controversies. Bitcoin, being unaffiliated with any corporation or bank is extremely hard to track. This lead to it being a currency on the Deep Web where criminals are able to sell a range of illegal items from weapons to drugs to videos featuring child exploitation. As a result, there are politicians both within the United States and in other countries who are looking to ban/place restrictions on the cryptocurrency.
